# PirateIsland

The aim of this project is to create a working game in the interactive-fiction style in the style of games from say Infocom, but nowhere
near the complexity of their classic games.

# Background

For those unfamiliar with the game-style, it is bascially a game where the player walks around in a fictional setting solving puzzles
using only keyboard commands such as "go east", "inventory", "open door", "examine hat" etc. The aim is to, of course, set solve the
game. 

The games are usually somewhat open-ended in that there are several paths one might take to solve it and one does not necessarily have
to do things in a certain order.

The games also often contain objects and locations that can only be considered red herrings to throw the player off but won't be necessary
to actually finish the game.

Three screenshots to give a better idea of how it might look like:
